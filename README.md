## ✨ Animations

To make your README even more dynamic, you can add animations with **CSS**. Here's an example of how to animate text and other elements.

### Fade-In Effect

Use this code to make elements fade in as the page loads:

```html
<div class="fade-in">
    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This content fades in as you load the page.</p>
</div>

<style>
.fade-in {
    animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
</style>
<div class="slide-in">
    <h2>Explore My Projects</h2>
    <p>Scroll down to see my projects slide in!</p>
</div>

<style>
.slide-in {
    animation: slideIn 1s ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideIn {
    from {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
    to {
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
</style>
<button class="animated-btn">Click Me</button>

<style>
.animated-btn {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.animated-btn:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
</style>
